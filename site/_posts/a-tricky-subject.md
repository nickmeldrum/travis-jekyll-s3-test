# The locker room

when a workplace is made more discrimination and harrassment free, does it become a less exciting place for a brogrammer to work in?

It's all about a balance. Surely every sane, mature human being wants a sensitive non discriminating and harrassment free workplace for everyone. But no one wants a place where people think their discussion and possibly even their thoughts are policed to be more politically correct. We don't want a police state.

I guess we have to discriminate between 2 similar but not identical goals:

 1. Enforce the law around discrimination and ensure an equal and harrasment free workplace
 2. Help grow our colleagues sensibilities to understand and be mindful of sexism

I have an absolute responsibility as a lead of a development team to do number 1. Number 2 cannot of course be enforced. Much as I would like to have 100% of the people I work with understand the language they use and even their actions can be grossly inappropriate and harmful to women, I cannot enforce it. I of course can enforce what is appropriate and what is allowed in the workplace.

Back to the original question then - is it true that it's become a less exciting place for the brogrammer to work in? That is such a subtly deep question. What kind of things does the brogrammer want to talk about with other brogrammers that they now can't? My guess is that they would fall into 1 of 2 categories:

 1. They want to make jokes that can be interpreted as women being less than men
 2. They want to objectify/ sexualise women

Clearly, neither of these things are appropriate as they could both clearly come under the EU discrimination laws. Number 1 is just a shame and I don't understand why even in the locker room people still want to do this. Number 2 is a tougher one perhaps? Clearly objectifying women is inherently bad as by definition it's boiling women down to 1 facet: their sexual attraction instead of realising they are a human being with many facets. However, I cannot pretend to not notice women in a sexual manner. It's part of being a man. I can't deny it and therefore why can I not enjoy it in an appropriate manner with others.

Delve into that a bit more - imagine what is an "appropriate" way of discussing that without objectification? is it possible?
