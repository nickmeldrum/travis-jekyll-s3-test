While trying to get volunteers from our development team excited about delivering some technical presentations to the rest of the team I created a list of talks that I would like to hear.

These are all talks that I would love to give myself. Mostly because giving a talk would force me to learn more about it. I will never have the time to do even half of them. I am hoping therefore that the team will pick up some of them. Or even better, deliver something else totally from their own interests.

In the mean time: I will be delivering to the team: "The  Powerful world of Powershell" tomorrow. I'll post some of it up here after the  presentation.

I thought it might be interesting to post the list of talks up here though. This list is in no particular order, and is very messy - just a stream of my consciousness as I thought about possible presentation titles. If anyone has some good content on any of these topics, please point me to them!

Note, this list is very purposefully targetted towards web developers working on the Microsoft .Net platform mostly in C# on MVC against MS SQL Server in an agile environment. Which is what our team is mostly!
