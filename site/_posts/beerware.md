So I was reviewing the license agreement for the fantastic Red Gate SQL Compare tools and I came across this:

> **SCHEDULE 3**
>  **BEERWARE**
>  The following Beerware is licensed on a free basis:*
>  DTS Package Compare
>  SQL Log Rescue
>  SQL Search
>  * subject to a non-binding obligation on the Licensee (or their representative) to buy a beer for a representative of the Licensor at any trade conference at which the Licensee (or their representative) and the Licensor's representative are both present, provided, however, that the Licensee (or their representative) should not attempt to purchase a beer where to do so would be unlawful in the relevant jurisdiction.

LOL

Much more tempting to license any of my projects as beerware instead of FOSS under creative commons!  See the original here: [http://www.red-gate.com/purchase/license.pdf](http://www.red-gate.com/purchase/license.pdf)
