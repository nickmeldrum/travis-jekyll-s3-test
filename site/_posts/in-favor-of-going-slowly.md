# in favor of going slowly

a dev complains about "the waste of companies money" when getting all the devs together in a room for an hour or so to discuss stuff...

i disagree about the waste. any time taken to work out whether a) what we are doing is best (the direction) or b) how we are trying to get there (the vehicle we are using) is not wasted. Almost any amount of time. definitely more time than I've ever seen companies/ teams take on this stuff.

devs hate meetings and maybe that's what they are really complaining about. They want to be cutting code. And that is a risk to the business. Let's say that again in big quoty font because it's so important:

'The developer's natural urges are a risk to the business.'

If the company is writing their software in the absolutely leanest and most optimal way and they are going in exactly the right direction I believe it should take very little effort to get where you are going.
