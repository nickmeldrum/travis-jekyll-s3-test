## in which my first proper open source contribution gets lost in the void

*shrug*

idea: talk about my contriubtion to git-credential-winstore

did everything properly:

* searched around for other people having solved this first
* stackoverflow post with someone else asking for it only result
* forked the project, fixed it and issued a pull request (1 clean commit with changes in original coding style etc.) with a good summary of changes
* answered stackoverflow post with detailed answer on how to use new fork

...

silence...

although the original repo is heavily used (and even referenced from the git scm documentation) the original author hasn't ever responded to pull requests and hasn't touched the repo in years. That is his choice of course, and it's great he wrote it in the first place. Also he is clearly doing alot of other open source work over at github.

And so what? I did it because I needed it and I can just my own repo.

Whats the problem?

Nothing really, except I was hoping my first contribution would have involved more of a ticker-tape parade. Seriously, my fix was absolutely trivial so I'm not bothered - though I would have liked my stackoverflow post to at least have been accepted or upvoted. Instead he added insult to injury by commenting with "awesome" instead of actually upvoting me.

Instead it just got me thinking about how this might have affected a more impressionable younger more emotional me. "Why bother doing stuff right if it's ignored" kinda thing.

So does starting an open source project infer a... omg blah blah blah this is probably a shit post...
